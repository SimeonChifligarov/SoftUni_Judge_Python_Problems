# Create a class Class. The __init__ method should receive the name of the class.
# It should also have 2 lists (students and grades).
# Create a class attribute __students_count equal to 22. The class should also have 3 additional methods:
# •	add_student(name, grade) - if there is space in the class, add the student and the grade in the two lists
# •	get_average_grade() - returns the average of all existing grades formatted to the second decimal point (as a number)
# •	__repr__ - returns the string (single line):
# "The students in {class_name}: {students}. Average grade: {get_average_grade()}".
# The students must be seperated by ",
