# Read two integer numbers and after that exchange their values by using some programming logic. Print the variable values before and after the exchange, as shown below:

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

print('Before:')
print(f'a = {a}')
print(f'b = {b}')
print('After:')
print(f'a = {b}')
print(f'b = {a}')
